# ITR-Spam-Detection
-In this project we have a dataset is about messages with labeled category (ham , spam)

-After doing some operations on that data, we came up with a model that is 97.8% accurate, which is very good

-Then I used Flask for the backend and html and css for the front end and I linked them and then hosted the project on heroku cloud
